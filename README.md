# Text Composer for Obsidian

Text Composer is an Obsidian plugin that compiles a markdown document by recursively including the content of linked documents. This plugin ensures that your main document remains unchanged, while generating a new compiled document.

## Features

- Compile `.md` documents by merging content from linked documents.
- Recursively handle nested document links.
- Generate a new `.md` file with the compiled content, leaving the original document unchanged.
